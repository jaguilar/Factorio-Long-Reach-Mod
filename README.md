#Long Reach

This is a very simple mod. It just sets the reach distance to a very large
value.

##Rationale

Do you ever find it annoying that you're not quite close enough to something to
place it? Are you playing marathon mode and constantly running around your base
refilling chests in the early game? Would you prefer Factorio to play more like
an RTS? This mod is for you.

If this mod is active, you can reach basically anything you can see in the
viewport. In fact, you can reach much further than that, but since you can't
scroll that far, you won't.

##Caveats

Why `data-final-fixes.lua`? I don't know. data.lua didn't work. Maybe some other
mod was overriding the player prototype. This mod tries to take precedence
over all other mods that affect the reach distance. If you don't want that, this
mod is not for you.

## How to install:
*Copied from https://wiki.factorio.com/index.php?title=Installing_Mods*

1. Download the mod you would like
2. You (normally) don't need to unzip them! (Unzipping is optional since v0.10!)
3. Copy the mod into the game's Application Directory/mods directory. If the directory doesn't exist, create it.
4. Run the game
5. Open the Mods menu and make sure the mod is enabled (requires restart on changes)
